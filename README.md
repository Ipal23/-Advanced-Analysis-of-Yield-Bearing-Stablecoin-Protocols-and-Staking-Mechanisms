# Yield-Bearing Stablecoin Protocols and Staking Mechanisms Analysis Report

## Introduction

Yield-bearing stablecoins have gained significant traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, providing investors with opportunities to earn returns on their holdings while maintaining price stability. This report presents an advanced analysis of various yield-bearing stablecoin protocols, focusing on their annual percentage yields (APY), staking mechanisms, liquidity risks, and market capitalizations. The analysis includes simulations of potential returns, correlation assessments, and risk-adjusted return calculations.

## Stablecoin Overview

The following yield-bearing stablecoins were analyzed:

| Stablecoin | APY (%) | Type            | Backing Assets           | Liquidity Risk | Custody Model    | Staking Rewards (%) | Market Cap (Billion $) |
|------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| sDAI       | 5.0     | DeFi Native     | DAI                      | Medium         | Custodial        | 10                   | 1.2                     |
| USDM       | 5.0     | Auto-Rebasing   | US Treasuries            | Low            | Non-Custodial    | 8                    | 0.8                     |
| eUSDC      | 4.5     | DeFi Native     | USDC                     | Medium         | Custodial        | 7                    | 0.9                     |
| sUSDT      | 4.0     | DeFi Native     | USDT                     | Medium         | Custodial        | 6                    | 1.0                     |
| stEUR      | 3.5     | Traditional Assets| Euro-denominated assets  | High           | Custodial        | 5                    | 0.5                     |

### Key Characteristics

- **APY**: Represents the annualized yield offered by each stablecoin.
- **Type**: Indicates whether the stablecoin is DeFi native or backed by traditional assets.
- **Backing Assets**: Details the assets that back the stablecoins.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Assesses the risk associated with liquidity for each stablecoin.
- **Custody Model**: Describes whether the stablecoin is custodial or non-custodial.
- **Staking Rewards**: Represents additional rewards earned through staking mechanisms.
- **Market Cap**: Reflects the market capitalization of each stablecoin.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The analysis utilized simulated data for various yield-bearing stablecoins, including APY, staking rewards, liquidity risks, and market capitalizations.

### Calculations

1. **Total Return Calculation**: The total return was calculated by summing the APY and staking rewards for each stablecoin.
2. **Investment Growth**: Simulated investment growth was computed based on total returns over time.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix was generated to analyze relationships between APY, staking rewards, and market capitalization.
4. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The Sharpe Ratio was calculated to assess risk-adjusted returns based on total returns and staking rewards.

## Results

### Performance Metrics

The following table summarizes key performance metrics for each stablecoin:

| Stablecoin | APY (%) | Staking Rewards (%) | Total Return (%) | Investment Growth (%) |
|------------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| sDAI       | 5.0     | 10                   | 15.0              | 1.77                  |
